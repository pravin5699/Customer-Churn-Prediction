    "📊 Customer Churn Prediction System\n",
    "📌 Project Overview\n",
    "Customer churn is a critical business problem where customers stop using a company’s services, directly impacting revenue and growth. This project builds an end-to-end machine learning system to predict customer churn and provide actionable business insights to enable proactive retention strategies.\n",
